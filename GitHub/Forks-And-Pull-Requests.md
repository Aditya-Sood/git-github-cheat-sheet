**Forks** : Feature of GitHub, used to copy someone else's repository into your GitHub account directly (instead of cloning a local copy and then pushing it to your account). It also gives recognition to the original creator of the repository.

- Useful for making additions/suggestions to the original repository. This is how most open-source contributions work - Contributors fork the original project repository, make changes on their copy of the same, and request the maintainers of the original repository to merge the same after review.

__Pull Requests__: A GitHub feature used to request for a branch to be reviewed before merging it with another branch, which is generally the master branch of a repository (original or forked).

- A branch is created and pushed as normal to the GitHub repository. A pull request is then issued from GitHub.

- One can 'modify' a pull request by simply modifying the branch being requested to be merged, since a pull request is associated with the branch (and not a particular commit).

- While pull requests generate email alerts, branch modifications don't. So add comments on the pull request thread informing about branch changes to inform concerned parties (comments generate email alerts).

__Issues/Enhancements__ - Most open source projects have an issues/enhancements list on the project's GitHub page which can help you get started with the project.

- Etiquette is important when collaborating with other people. Always be respectful of others, and if you're a new to the technology and/or project, take the remarks from the more experienced project maintainers with a pinch of salt.
